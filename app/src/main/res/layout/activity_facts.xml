Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S. Nearly 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily in the U.S. Nearly 21 million blood components are transfused each year in the U.S. The average red blood cell transfusion is approximately 3 pints. The blood type most often requested by hospitals is type O. The blood used in an emergency is already on the shelves before the event occurs. It is estimated that sickle cell disease affects 90,000 to 100,000 people in the U.S. About 1,000 babies are born with the disease each year. Sickle cell patients can require frequent blood transfusions throughout their lives. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 1.69 million people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer in 2017. Many of them will need blood, sometimes daily, during their chemotherapy treatment. A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 pints of blood."

            android:text="Donating blood is a safe process. A sterile needle is used only once for each donor and then discarded. Blood donation is a simple four-step process: registration, medical history and mini-physical, donation and refreshments. Every blood donor is given a mini-physical, checking the donor's temperature, blood pressure, pulse and hemoglobin to ensure it is safe for the donor to give blood. The actual blood donation typically takes less than 10-12 minutes. The entire process, from the time you arrive to the time you leave, takes about an hour and 15 minutes.Donors may save time by completing a RapidPass on the day of their donation prior to arriving at the blood drive. The average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his body. Roughly 1 pint is given during a donation. A healthy donor may donate red blood cells every 56 days or Power Red every 112 days. A healthy donor may donate platelets as few as 7 days apart, but a maximum of 24 times a year. All donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases before it can be released to hospitals. Information you give to the American Red Cross during the donation process is confidential. It may not be released without your permission except as directed by law."
